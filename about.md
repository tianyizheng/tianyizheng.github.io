## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/atlanta.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I graduated with the highest honor from Georgia Tech with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in robotics and automation. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree with a joint track of robotics and computer science to prepare for a higher level learning in AI and robotics.

My technical background mostly involves backend development, control theory, mechatronics and linear algebra. I enjoy programming and am proficient in python, C/C++, Java and Matlab. I love learning new skills and keeping up with the latest technology advances. 

Besides tech, here's some other things that I love: standup comedies, skiing, fantasy novels, fitness, italian food and the TV show Friends.

<h2 class="section-title"><i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i>Education</h2>

#### MS in Mechanical Engineering

#### Georgia Institute of Technology

<p>
  My major area of focus is in robotics with a minor area in computer science. 
  I am interested in the semantic scene understanding, applied machine learning and control of autonomous robots. 
  I am currently working on a thesis proposal in the area of applied machine learning and control of robotics.
</p>

#### BS in Mechanical Engineering

#### Georgia Institute of Technology

<p>
  I graduated with highest honor with a concentration in robotics and automation in May, 2017.
  In addition to my major area of study, I devoted my time in studying control theory, mechatronics and computer science. 
  I also conducted undergraduate research in creating control algorithm to BioMechanic instruments and worked as an intern for 
  a startup company prototyping a novel water-saving tap

#### Lead Mechanical Intern

<h4><a href="http://www.mymuyu.com">Muyu Technology</a>, Beijing</h4>

<p>
 Muyu technology is a startup company developing novel water-saving tap systems.
  My main project was to design, develop and prototyp a vibration and noise reduction 
  solution for a small air pump in Solidworks while ensuring compactness, manufacturability 
  and improving its heat transfer efficiency. As the project lead, I worked with three other interns,
  delegated tasks, managed BOM and developed a lowcost bakelite module that secures the pump
  and reduces noise by 15 dB. Our module was later submitted for a patent application. I also worked closely with the electronics engineers, product designer 
  and the fluid engineer to optimize the size of the fluid module by 50% and ensure 
  correct dimensional requirements.
  <br> <br>
  I joined the company at its early stage and had the chance to work closely under the CTO. 
  In addition to engineering works, I also contacted potential parts suppliers and manufacturers 
  to survey and negotiate price. Most importantly I had the opportunity to experience the 
  product development cycle and pitch our product to angel inverstors and VC firms
</p>

#### Undergraduate Research Intern

<h4><a href="http://www.sulchek2.gatech.edu">Sulchek Lab</a>, Georgia Tech, Atlanta</h4>

<p>
    My reserach topic was on the rapid determination of microcantilevel
  quality factor to promote maintenance of the atomic force microscope tip-sample distance. 
  I developed automation scripts in Igor Pro to collect and filter thermal noise data with optimal 
  frequency for fast curve fitting using the Lorentzian function model. I further analyzed 
  the quality factor versus tip-sample distance behavior and designed a PID controller to achieve 
  fixed-distance tip-hovering that enables the AFM to collect live cell topology data autonomously
  over long periods of time.
