## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I graduated with the highest honor from Georgia Tech with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in robotics and automation. 

Receiving the benefits of content is a certain something. Be that as it may, it's so substantially less demanding once you begin conveying all the more successfully. The profitable content thought isn't just about bragging your item's capacities and general worth or your organization's achievements. You should concentrate less on advertising how awesome your item is and rather concentrate on indicating how valuable it is. This is a client focused approach as it concentrates on their issues and your answer for them. Making yourself fundamental is critical.

### Education

#### MS in Mechanical Engineering

#### Georgia Institute of Technology

<p>
  My major area of focus is in robot perception with a minor area in computer science. 
  I am interested in the semantic scene understanding, path planning and control of autonomous robots. 
  I am currently looking for a research opportunity in the area of SLAM and semantic segmentation.
</p>

#### BS in Mechanical Engineering

#### Georgia Institute of Technology

<p>
  I graduated with highest honor with a concentration in robotics and automation in May, 2017.
  In addition to my major area of study, I devoted my time in studying control theory, mechatronics and computer science. 
  I also conducted undergraduate research in applying control algorithm to BioMechanic instruments and worked as an intern for 
  a startup company prototyping a novel water-saving tap

### Experience

#### Lead mechanical Intern
<p>
 Muyu technology is a startup company developing novel water-saving tap systems.
  My main project was to design, develop and prototyp a vibration and noise reduction 
  solution for a small air pump in Solidworks while ensuring compactness, manufacturability 
  and improving its heat transfer efficiency. As the project lead, I worked with three other interns,
  delegated tasks, managed BOM and developed a lowcost bakelite housing that secures the pump
  and reduces noise by 15 dB. I also worked closely with the electronics engineers, product designer 
  and the fluid engineer to optimize the size of the fluid module by 50% and ensure 
  correct dimensional requirements.
  <br> <br>
  I joined the company at its early stage and had the chance to work closely under the CTO. 
  In addition to engineering works, I also contacted potential parts suppliers and manufacturers 
  to survey and negotiate price. Most importantly I had the opportunity to experience the 
  product development cycle and pitch our product to angel inverstors and VC firms
</p>

#### Undergraduate Research Intern

<p>
    My reserach topic was on the rapid determination of microcantilevel
  quality factor to promote maintenance of the atomic force microscope tip-sample distance. 
  I developed automation scripts in Igor Pro to collect and filter thermal noise data with optimal 
  frequency for fast curve fitting using the Lorentzian function model. I further analyzed 
  the quality factor versus tip-sample distance behavior and designed a PID controller to achieve 
  fixed-distance tip-hovering that enables the AFM to collect live cell topology data autonomously
  over long periods of time.

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information.
